class Sensor(BaseGeo, BaseDisplayRepr):
    """Magnetic field sensor.

    Can be used as `observers` input for magnetic field computation.

    When `position=(0,0,0)` and `orientation=None` local object coordinates
    coincide with the global coordinate system.

    A sensor is made up of pixel (sensing elements / positions) where the magnetic
    field is evaluated.

    SI units are used for all inputs and outputs.

    Parameters
    ----------

    position: array_like, shape (3,) or (m,3), default=`(0,0,0)`
        Object position(s) in the global coordinates in units of m. For m>1, the
        `position` and `orientation` attributes together represent an object path.

    pixel: array_like, shape (3,) or (n1,n2,...,3), default=`(0,0,0)`
        Sensor pixel (=sensing elements) positions in the local object coordinates
        (rotate with object), in units of m.

    orientation: scipy `Rotation` object with length 1 or m, default=`None`
        Object orientation(s) in the global coordinates. `None` corresponds to
        a unit-rotation. For m>1, the `position` and `orientation` attributes
        together represent an object path.

    parent: `Collection` object or `None`
        The object is a child of it's parent collection.

    style: dict
        Object style inputs must be in dictionary form, e.g. `{'color':'red'}` or
        using style underscore magic, e.g. `style_color='red'`.

    handedness: {"right", "left"}
        Object local coordinate system handedness. If "left", the x-axis is flipped.

    Returns
    -------
    observer: `Sensor` object

    Examples
    --------
    `Sensor` objects are observers for magnetic field computation. In this example we compute the
    B-field in units of T as seen by the sensor in the center of a circular current loop:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import magpylib as magpy
    >>> sens = magpy.Sensor()
    >>> loop = magpy.current.Circle(current=1, diameter=0.01)
    >>> B = sens.getB(loop)
    >>> with np.printoptions(precision=3):
    ...     print(B*1000)
    [0.    0.    0.126]

    We rotate the sensor by 45 degrees and compute the field again:

    >>> sens.rotate_from_rotvec((45,0,0))
    Sensor(id=...)
    >>> B = sens.getB(loop)
    >>> with np.printoptions(precision=3):
    ...     print(B)
    [0.000e+00 8.886e-05 8.886e-05]

    Finally we set some sensor pixels and compute the field again:

    >>> sens.pixel=((0,0,0), (.001,0,0), (.002,0,0))
    >>> B = sens.getB(loop)
    >>> with np.printoptions(precision=3):
    ...     print(B)
    [[0.000e+00 8.886e-05 8.886e-05]

        Parameters

            Sources that generate the magnetic field. Can be a single source (or collection)
            or a 1D list of l source and/or collection objects.

        sumup: bool, default=`False`
            If `True`, the fields of all sources are summed up.

        squeeze: bool, default=`True`
            If `True`, the output is squeezed, i.e. all axes of length 1 in the output (e.g. only
            a single sensor or only a single source) are eliminated.

            Reference to a compatible numpy aggregator function like `'min'` or `'mean'`,
            which is applied to observer output values, e.g. mean of all sensor pixel outputs.
            With this option, observers input with different (pixel) shapes is allowed.

        output: str, default='ndarray'
            Output type, which must be one of `('ndarray', 'dataframe')`. By default a
            `numpy.ndarray` object is returned. If 'dataframe' is chosen, a `pandas.DataFrame`

        in_out: {'auto', 'inside', 'outside'}
            This parameter only applies for magnet bodies. It specifies the location of the
            observers relative to the magnet body, affecting the calculation of the magnetic field.
            The options are:
            - 'auto': The location (inside or outside the cuboid) is determined automatically for
            each observer.
            - 'inside': All observers are considered to be inside the cuboid; use this for

            - 'outside': All observers are considered to be outside the cuboid; use this for
              performance optimization if applicable.
            Choosing 'auto' is fail-safe but may be computationally intensive if the mix of observer
            locations is unknown.

        Returns
        -------
        B-field: ndarray, shape squeeze(l, m, n1, n2, ..., 3) or DataFrame

        Examples
        --------
        Test if there is polarization at the location of the sensor.

        >>> import numpy as np

        >>> J = sens.getJ(cube)

## The idea behind Magpylib

Magpylib provides fast and accurate magnetostatic field computation based on **analytical solutions** to permanent magnet and current problems. The field computation is coupled to a **position and orientation interface** that makes it easy to work with relative object positioning. The idea behind the main object oriented interface is:

1. Sensors, magnets, currents, etc. are created as Python objects with defined position and orientation in a global coordinate system.
2. After initialization, the Magpylib objects can easily be manipulated, grouped and moved around.
3. All objects can be displayed graphically using Matplotlib or Plotly 3D plotting.
4. Finally, the magnetic field generated by the source objects is computed at given observers.

The following example code outlines this functionality:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import magpylib as magpy

# 1. define sources and observers as objects
cube = magpy.magnet.Cuboid(magnetization=(0,0,100), dimension=(1,1,1))
loop = magpy.current.Loop(current=5, diameter=3, position=(0,0,-3))
sensor = magpy.Sensor(position=(0,0,2), style_size=1.8)

# 2. move objects around, define object paths
cube.position = np.linspace((-3,0,0), (3,0,0), 50)
cube.rotate_from_angax(angle=np.linspace(0,180,50), axis='z', start=0)
loop.move(np.linspace((0,0,0), (0,0,6), 50), start=0)
sensor.rotate_from_rotvec((0,0,225), degrees=True)

# 3. display system graphically
magpy.show(loop, cube, sensor, backend='plotly', animation=2, style_path_show=False)

# 4. compute field at sensor (and plot with Matplotlib)
B = sensor.getB(cube, loop, sumup=True)

plt.plot(B)
plt.show()
```

For users who would like to avoid the object oriented interface, the field implementations can also be accessed directly, see {ref}`intro-direct-interface`. Details on how the analytical solutions are mathematically obtained can be found in the {ref}`physComp` section.

(intro-when-to-use)=

## When can you use Magpylib ?

The analytical solutions are exact when there is no material response and natural boundary conditions can be assumed. In general, Magpylib is at its best when dealing with air-coils (no eddy currents) and high grade permanent magnet assemblies (Ferrite, NdFeB, SmCo or similar materials).

When magnet permeabilities are below $\mu_r < 1.1$ the error typically undercuts 1-5 % (long magnet shapes are better, large distance from magnet is better). Demagnetization factors are not automatically included at this point. The line current solutions give the exact same field as outside of a wire that carries a homogenous current. For more details check out the {ref}`physComp` section.

Magpylib only provides solutions for simple geometric forms (cuboids, clinders, lines, ...). How complex shapes can be constructed from these simple base shapes is described in {ref}`examples-complex-forms`.

(intro-magpylib-objects)=

## The Magpylib objects

The most convenient way for working with Magpylib is through the **object oriented interface**. Magpylib objects represent magnetic field sources, sensors and collections with various defining attributes and methods. The following classes are implemented:

**Magnets**

All magnet objects have the `magnetization` attribute which must be of the format $(m_x, m_y, m_z)$ and denotes the homogeneous magnetization vector in units of \[mT\]. It is often referred to as the remanence ($B_r=\mu_0 M$) in material data sheets. All magnets can be used as Magpylib `sources` input.

- **`Cuboid`**`(magnetization, dimension, position, orientation, style)` represents a magnet with cuboid shape. `dimension` has the format $(a,b,c)$ and denotes the sides of the cuboid in units of \[mm\]. By default (`position=(0,0,0)`, `orientation=None`) the center of the cuboid lies in the origin of the global coordinates, and the sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.

- **`Cylinder`**`(magnetization, dimension, position, orientation, style)` represents a magnet with cylindrical shape. `dimension` has the format $(d,h)$ and denotes diameter and height of the cylinder in units of \[mm\]. By default (`position=(0,0,0)`, `orientation=None`) the center of the cylinder lies in the origin of the global coordinates, and the cylinder axis coincides with the z-axis.

- **`CylinderSegment`**`(magnetization, dimension, position, orientation, style)` represents a magnet with the shape of a cylindrical ring section. `dimension` has the format $(r_1,r_2,h,\varphi_1,\varphi_2)$ and denotes inner radius, outer radius and height in units of \[mm\] and the two section angles $\varphi_1<\varphi_2$ in \[deg\]. By default (`position=(0,0,0)`, `orientation=None`) the center of the full cylinder lies in the origin of the global coordinates, and the cylinder axis coincides with the z-axis.

- **`Sphere`**`(magnetization, diameter, position, orientation, style)` represents a magnet of spherical shape. `diameter` is the sphere diameter $d$ in units of \[mm\]. By default (`position=(0,0,0)`, `orientation=None`) the center of the sphere lies in the origin of the global coordinates.

**Currents**

All current objects have the `current` attribute which must be a scalar $i_0$ and denotes the electrical current in units of \[A\]. All currents can be used as Magpylib `sources` input.

- **`Loop`**`(current, diameter, position, orientation, style)` represents a circular current loop where `diameter` is the loop diameter $d$ in units of \[mm\]. By default (`position=(0,0,0)`, `orientation=None`) the loop lies in the xy-plane with its center in the origin of the global coordinates.

- **`Line`**`(current, vertices, position, orientation, style)` represents electrical current segments that flow in a straight line from vertex to vertex. By default (`position=(0,0,0)`, `orientation=None`) the locally defined vertices have the same position in the global coordinates.

**Other**

- **`Dipole`**`(moment, position, orientation, style)` represents a magnetic dipole moment with moment $(m_x,m_y,m_z)$ given in \[mT mm³]. For homogeneous magnets the relation moment=magnetization$\times$volume holds. Can be used as Magpylib `sources` input.

- **`CustomSource`**`(field_B_lambda, field_H_lambda, position, orientation, style)` can be used to create user defined custom sources. Can be used as Magpylib `sources` input.

- **`Sensor`**`(position, pixel, orientation)` represents a 3D magnetic field sensor. The field is evaluated at the given pixel positions, by default `pixel=(0,0,0)`. Can be used as Magpylib `observers` input.

- **`Collection`**`(*children, position, orientation)` is a group of source and sensor objects (children) that is used for common manipulation. Depending on the children, a collection can be used as Magpylib `sources` and/or `observers` input.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import magpylib as magpy

# magnets
magnet1 = magpy.magnet.Cuboid()
magnet2 = magpy.magnet.Cylinder()
magnet3 = magpy.magnet.CylinderSegment()
magnet4 = magpy.magnet.Sphere()

# currents
current1 = magpy.current.Loop()
current2 = magpy.current.Line()

# other
dipole = magpy.misc.Dipole()
custom = magpy.misc.CustomSource()
sensor = magpy.Sensor()
coll   = magpy.Collection()

# print object representation
for obj in [magnet1, magnet2, magnet3, magnet4, current1, current2, dipole, custom, sensor, coll]:
    print(obj)
```

(intro-position-and-orientation)=

## Position and orientation

All Magpylib objects have the `position` and `orientation` attributes that refer to position and orientation in the global Cartesian coordinate system. The `position` attribute is a numpy ndarray, shape (3,) or (m,3) and denotes the coordinates $(x,y,z)$ in units of [mm]. By default every object is created at `position=(0,0,0)`. The `orientation` attribute is a scipy [Rotation object](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation.html) and denotes the object rotation (relative to its initial state), e.g. in terms of Euler angles $(\phi, \psi, \theta)$. By default the orientation of a Magpylib object is the unit rotation, `orientation=None`.

```python
import magpylib as magpy

sensor = magpy.Sensor()

print(sensor.position)                                     # out: [0. 0. 0.]
print(sensor.orientation.as_euler('xyz', degrees=True))    # out: [0. 0. 0.]
```

Set absolute object position/orientation at initialization or through the properties directly. Add relative position/orientation with the `move` and `rotate` methods,

```python
import magpylib as magpy
from scipy.spatial.transform import Rotation as R

# set at initialization
sensor = magpy.Sensor(position=(1,1,1))
print(sensor.position)                                     # out: [1. 1. 1.]
print(sensor.orientation.as_euler('xyz', degrees=True))    # out: [0. 0. 0.]

# set properties directly
sensor.orientation = R.from_rotvec((0,0,45), degrees=True)
print(sensor.position)                                     # out: [1. 1. 1.]
print(sensor.orientation.as_euler('xyz', degrees=True))    # out: [ 0.  0. 45.]

# move and rotate
sensor.move((1,2,3))
sensor.rotate_from_angax(45, 'z')
print(sensor.position)                                     # out: [2. 3. 4.]
print(sensor.orientation.as_euler('xyz', degrees=True))    # out: [ 0.  0. 90.]
```

The attributes `position` and `orientation` can be either of **"scalar"** nature, i.e. a single position or a single rotation like in the examples above, or **"vectors"** when they are arrays of such scalars. The two attributes together define an object **"path"**. Paths should always be used when modelling object motion as the magnetic field is computed on the whole path.

With vector inputs, the `move` and `rotate` methods provide *append* and *merge* functionality.  The following example shows how a path `path1` is assigned to a magnet object, how `path2` is appended with `move` and how `path3` is merged on top starting at path index 25.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
from magpylib.magnet import Cylinder

magnet = Cylinder(magnetization=(100,0,0), dimension=(2,2))

# assign path
path1 = np.linspace((0,0,0), (0,0,5), 20)
magnet.position = path1

# append path
path2 = np.linspace((0,0,0), (0,10,0), 40)
magnet.move(path2[1:])

# merge path
path3 = np.linspace(0, 360, 20)
magnet.rotate_from_angax(angle=path3, axis='z', anchor=0, start=25)

magnet.show(backend='plotly')
```

Notice that when one of the `position` and `orientation` attributes are modified in length, the other is automatically adjusted to the same length. A detailed outline of the functionality of `position`, `orientation`, `move`, `rotate` and paths is given in {ref}`examples-paths`.



(intro-graphic-output)=

## Graphic output

When all Magpylib objects and their paths have been created, **`show`** provides a convenient way to graphically display the geometric arrangement using the Matplotlib (default) and Plotly packages. The `backend` keyword argument is used in `show` to select the graphic backend.

When `show` is called, it generates a new figure which is then automatically displayed. To bring the output to a given, user-defined figure, the `canvas` kwarg is used.

The following example shows the graphical representation of various Magpylib objects and their paths using the default Matplotlib graphic backend.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import magpylib as magpy
from magpylib.magnet import Cuboid, Cylinder, CylinderSegment, Sphere
from magpylib.current import Loop, Line
from magpylib.misc import Dipole

sources = [
    Cuboid(
        magnetization=(0,100,0),
        dimension=(1,1,1),
        position=(-7,0,0),
    ),
    Cylinder(
        magnetization=(0,0,100),
        dimension=(1,1),
        position=(-5,0,0),
    ),
    CylinderSegment(
        magnetization=(0,0,100),
        dimension=(.3,1,1,0,140),
        position=(-3,0,0),
    ),
    Sphere(
        magnetization=(0,0,100),
        diameter=1,
        position=(-1,0,0),
    ),
    Loop(
        current=1,
        diameter=1,
        position=(1,0,0),
    ),
    Line(
        current=1,
        vertices=[(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (-1,0,0), (0,-1,0), (1,0,0)],
        position=(3,0,0),
    ),
    Dipole(
        moment=(0,0,100),
        position=(5,0,0),
    ),
]
sensor = magpy.Sensor(
    pixel=[(0,0,z) for z in (-.5,0,.5)],
    position=(7,0,0),
)

sources[5].move(np.linspace((0,0,0), (0,0,7), 20))
sources[0].rotate_from_angax(np.linspace(0, -90, 20), 'y', anchor=0)

magpy.show(sources, sensor)
```

Notice that, objects and their paths are automatically assigned different colors, the magnetization vector, current directions and dipole objects are indicated by arrows and sensors are shown as tri-colored coordinate cross with pixel as markers.

How objects are represented graphically (color, line thickness, ect.) is defined by the **style**. The default style, which can be seen above, is stored in the `magpy.defaults.display.style` object. In addition, each object can have its own style attribute that takes precedence over the default setting. Some practical ways to set styles are shown in the next example:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import magpylib as magpy
from magpylib.magnet import Cuboid

# change the default
magpy.defaults.display.style.base.color = 'crimson'
cube1 = Cuboid(magnetization=(0,0,1), dimension=(2,4,4))

# set individual style through property
cube2 = cube1.copy(position=(3,0,0))
cube2.style.color = 'orangered'

# set individual style through update with dictionary
cube3 = cube1.copy(position=(6,0,0))
cube3.style.update({'color': 'gold'})

# set individual style at initialization with underscore magic
cube4 = cube1.copy(position=(9,0,0), style_color='linen')

# show with local style override
magpy.show(cube1, cube2, cube3, cube4, style_magnetization_show=False)
```

A local style override is possible by passing style arguments directly to `show`. The hierarchy that descides about the final graphic object representation, a list of all styles and all other styling options for tuning the `show`-ouput are described in {ref}`examples-graphic-styles` and {ref}`examples-animation`.

(intro-field-computation)=

## Magnetic field computation

Magnetic field computation in Magpylib is achieved through:

- **`getB`**`(sources, observers)` computes the B-field seen by `observers` generated by `sources` in units of \[mT\]
- **`getH`**`(sources, observers)` computes the H-field seen by `observers` generated by `sources` in units of \[kA/m\]

The argument `sources` can be any Magpylib **source object** or a list thereof. The argument `observers` can be an array_like of position vectors with shape $(n_1,n_2,n_3,...,3)$, any Magpylib **observer object** or a list thereof. `getB` and `getH` will compute the field for all input combinations of sources, observers and paths.

```{note}
The output of the most general field computation `getB(sources, observers)` is an ndarray of shape `(l, m, k, n1, n2, n3, ..., 3)` where `l` is the number of input sources, `m` the (maximal) object path length, `k` the number of sensors, `n1,n2,n3,...` the sensor pixel shape or the shape of the observer position vector input and `3` the three magnetic field components $(B_x, B_y, B_z)$.
```

**Example 1:** As expressed by the old v2 slogan *"The magnetic field is only three lines of code away"*, this example demonstrates the most fundamental field computation:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import magpylib as magpy
src = magpy.current.Loop(current=1, diameter=2)
B = magpy.getB(src, (1,2,3))
print(B)
```

**Example 2:** When dealing with multiple observer positions, `getB` and `getH` will return the field in the shape of the observer input. In the following example, B- and H-field of a cuboid magnet are computed on a position grid, and then displayed using Matplotlib:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import magpylib as magpy

fig, [ax1,ax2] = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10,5))

# create an observer grid in the xz-symmetry plane
ts = np.linspace(-3, 3, 30)
grid = np.array([[(x,0,z) for x in ts] for z in ts])

# compute B- and H-fields of a cuboid magnet on the grid
src = magpy.magnet.Cuboid(magnetization=(500,0,500), dimension=(2,2,2))
B = src.getB(grid)
H = src.getH(grid)

# display field with Pyplot
ax1.streamplot(grid[:,:,0], grid[:,:,2], B[:,:,0], B[:,:,2], density=2,
    color=np.log(np.linalg.norm(B, axis=2)), linewidth=1, cmap='autumn')

ax2.streamplot(grid[:,:,0], grid[:,:,2], H[:,:,0], H[:,:,2], density=2,
    color=np.log(np.linalg.norm(B, axis=2)), linewidth=1, cmap='winter')

# outline magnet boundary
for ax in [ax1,ax2]:
    ax.plot([1,1,-1,-1,1], [1,-1,-1,1,1], 'k--')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

**Example 3:** The following example code shows how the field in a position system is computed with a sensor object. Both, magnet and sensor are moving. The 3D system and the field along the path are displayed with Plotly:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import magpylib as magpy

# setup plotly figure and subplots
fig = go.Figure().set_subplots(rows=1, cols=2, specs=[[{"type": "scene"}, {"type": "xy"}]])

# define sensor and source
sensor = magpy.Sensor(pixel=[(0,0,-.1), (0,0,.1)], style_size=1.5)
magnet = magpy.magnet.Cylinder(magnetization=(100,0,0), dimension=(1,2))

# define paths
sensor.position = np.linspace((0,0,-3), (0,0,3), 40)

magnet.position = (4,0,0)
magnet.rotate_from_angax(angle=np.linspace(0, 300, 40)[1:], axis='z', anchor=0)

# display system in 3D
temp_fig = go.Figure()
magpy.show(magnet, sensor, canvas=temp_fig, backend='plotly')
fig.add_traces(temp_fig.data, rows=1, cols=1)

# compute field and plot
B = magpy.getB(magnet, sensor)
for i,plab in enumerate(['pixel1', 'pixel2']):
    for j,lab in enumerate(['_Bx', '_By', '_Bz']):
        fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=np.arange(40), y=B[:,i,j], name=plab+lab))

fig.show()
```

**Example 4:** The last example demonstrates the most general form of a `getB` computation with multiple source and sensor inputs. Specficifically, 3 sources, one with path length 11, and two sensors, each with pixel shape (4,5). Note that, when input objects have different path lengths, all shorter paths are padded (= objects remain "static") beyond their end.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import magpylib as magpy

# 3 sources, one with length 11 path
source1 = magpy.misc.Dipole(moment=(0,0,100), position=[(1,1,1)]*11)
source2 = magpy.current.Loop(current=1, diameter=3)
source3 = source1 + source2

# 2 observers, each with 4x5 pixel
sensor1 = magpy.Sensor(pixel=[[(1,2,3)]*4]*5)
sensor2 = sensor1.copy()

# compute field
B = magpy.getB([source1, source2, source3], [sensor1, sensor2])
print(B.shape)
```

In terms of **performance** it must be noted that Magpylib automatically vectorizes all computations when `getB` and `getH` are called. This reduces the compuation time dramically for large inputs. For maximal performance try to make all field computations with as few calls to `getB` and `getH` as possible.

(intro-direct-interface)=

## Direct interface and core

The **direct interface** allows users to bypass the object oriented functionality of Magpylib. The magnetic field is computed for a set of arbitrary input instances by providing the top level functions `getB` and `getH` with 

1. a string denoting the source type for the `sources` argument,
2. an array_like of shape (3,) or (n,3) giving the positions for the `observers` argument,
3. a dictionary with array_likes of shape (x,) or (n,x) for all other inputs.

All "scalar" inputs of shape (x,) are automatically tiled up to shape (n,x), and for every of the n given instances the field is computed and returned with shape (n,3). The allowed source types are similar to the Magpylib source class names (see {ref}`intro-magpylib-objects`), and the required dictionary inputs are the respective class inputs.

In the following example we compute the cuboid field for 5 different position and dimension input instances and "constant" magnetization:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import magpylib as magpy

B = magpy.getB(
    sources='Cuboid',
    observers=[(0,0,x) for x in range(5)],
    dimension=[(d,d,d) for d in range(1,6)],
    magnetization=(0,0,1000),
)

print(B)
```

The direct interface is convenient for users who work with complex inputs or favor a more functional programming paradigm. It is typically faster than the object oriented interface, but it also requires that users know how to generate the inputs efficiently with numpy (e.g. `np.arange`, `np.linspace`, `np.tile`, `np.repeat`, ...).

At the heart of Magpylib lies a set of **core functions** that are our implementations of the analytical field expressions, see {ref}`physcomp`. For users who are not interested in the position/orientation interface, the `magpylib.core` subpackage gives direct access to these functions. Inputs are ndarrays of shape (n,x). Details can be found in the respective function docstrings.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import magpylib as magpy

mag = np.array([(100,0,0)]*5)
dim = np.array([(1,2,3,45,90)]*5)
pos = np.array([(0,0,0)]*5)

B = magpy.core.magnet_cylinder_segment_field(mag, dim, pos, field='B')
print(B)
```

(intro-collections)=

## Collections

The top level class `Collection` allows users to group sources by reference for common manipulation. Objects that are part of a collection are called **children** of that collection. All operations acting on a collection are individually applied to its children.

```python
import magpylib as magpy

sphere = magpy.magnet.Sphere(magnetization=(1,2,3), diameter=1, position=(2,0,0))
loop = magpy.current.Loop(current=1, diameter=1, position=(-2,0,0))
coll = magpy.Collection(src1, src2)

print(sphere.position)   # out: [ 2.  0.  0.]
print(loop.position)     # out: [-2.  0.  0.]
print(coll.position)     # out: [ 0.  0.  0.]

coll.move(((0,0,2)))

print(sphere.position)   # out: [ 2.  0.  2.]
print(loop.position)     # out: [-2.  0.  2.]
print(coll.position)     # out: [ 0.  0.  2.]
```

Collections function primarily like groups. Magpylib objects can be part of multiple collections. After being added to a collection, it is still possible to manipulate the individual objects by reference, and also by collection index:

```python
sphere.move((2,0,0))
coll[1].move((-2,0,0))

print(sphere.position)   # out: [ 4.  0.  2.]
print(loop.position)     # out: [-4.  0.  2.]
print(coll.position)     # out: [ 0.  0.  2.]
```

A detailed review of collection properties and construction is provided in the example gallery {ref}`examples-collections-construction`.

Magpylib collections follow a *compound object philosophy*, which means that a collection behaves itself like a single object. Notice in the examples above, that `coll` has its own `position` and `orientation` attributes. Geometric operations acting on a collection object are individually applied to all child objects - but in such a way that the geometric compound structure is maintained. For example, applying `rotate` with `anchor=None` rotates all children about `collection.position` instead of the individual child positions. This is demonstrated in the following example:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import magpylib as magpy

cube1 = magpy.magnet.Cuboid((0,0,1), (1,1,1), (2,0,0))
cube2 = cube1.copy(position=(-2,0,0))
sensor = magpy.Sensor()
coll = cube1 + cube2 + sensor

coll.move(np.linspace((0,0,0), (0,2,0), 30))
coll.rotate_from_angax(np.linspace(0, 180, 30), 'y')

coll.show(animation=True, style_path_show=False, backend='plotly')
```

It should be noted that collections have their own `style` attributes. Their paths are displayed in `show` and all children are automatically given their parent color. An advanced tutorial how to create dynamic compound objects is given in {ref}`examples-collections-compound`.

(intro-customization)=

## Customization

**User-defined 3D models** (traces) that will be displayed by `show`, can be stored in `style.model3d.data`. A trace itself is a dictionary that contains all information necessary for plotting, and can be added with the method `style.model3d.data.add_trace`. In the example gallery {ref}`examples-3d-models` it is explained how to create custom traces with standard plotting backends such as `scatter3d` or `mesh3d` in Plotly, or `plot`, `plot_surface` and `plot_trisurf` in Matplotlib. Some pre-defined models are also provided for easy parts vizualization.

**User-defined source classes** are easily realized through the `CustomSource` class. Such a custom source object can be provided with user-defined field computation functions, that are stored in the attributes `field_B_lambda` and `field_H_lambda`, and will be used when `getB` and `getH` are called. The provided functions must accept position arrays with shape (n,3), and return the field with a similar shape. Details on working with custom sources are given in {ref}`examples-custom-source-objects`.

While each of these features can be used individually, the combination of the two (own source class with own 3D representation) enables a high level of customization in Magpylib. Such user-defined objects will feel like native Magpylib objects and can be used in combination with all other features, which is demonstrated in the following example:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import magpylib as magpy

# define B-field function for custom source
def custom_field(pos):
    """ easter field"""
    dist = np.linalg.norm(pos, axis=1)
    return np.c_[np.zeros((len(pos),2)), 1/dist**3]

# create custom source
egg = magpy.misc.CustomSource(
    field_B_lambda=custom_field,
    style=dict(color='orange', model3d_showdefault=False, label='The Egg'),
)

# add a custom 3D model
trace = magpy.graphics.model3d.make_Ellipsoid(
    backend='plotly',
    dimension=(1,1,1.4),
)
egg.style.model3d.add_trace(trace)

# move the egg
ts = np.linspace(-2*np.pi, 2*np.pi, 70)
ts = ts + 0.75*np.sin(ts-np.pi/8)**2
egg.position = [(t/3, 0, -0.2*np.sin(t)**2) for t in ts]
egg.rotate_from_euler(ts, 'y', start=0, degrees=False)

# add sensor and compute field on path
sensor = magpy.Sensor(position=(0,0,1.5), style_size=2)
B = sensor.getB(egg)

# animate path and plot field
magpy.show(egg, sensor, backend='plotly', animation=True, style_path_show=False)

fig = go.Figure()
for i,lab in enumerate(['Bx', 'By', 'Bz']):
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=ts/2*3, y=B[:,i], name=lab))
fig.update_layout(title='Field at sensor', xaxis_title='animation time [s]')
fig.show()
```

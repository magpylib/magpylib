# Installation and Dependencies

## Dependencies and Synergies

Magpylib supports *Python3.10+* and relies on common scientific computation libraries *NumPy* and *Scipy* for computation, and *Matplotlib* and *Plotly* for graphic outputs.

Optionally, *Pyvista* is supported as graphical backend, as well as *Pandas* for the field computation output.

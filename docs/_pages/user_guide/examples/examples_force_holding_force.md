# Magnetic Holding Force

The examples here require installation of the
[magpylib-force package](https://pypi.org/project/magpylib-force/). See also the
[magpylib-force documentation](docs-magpylib-force).

With Magpylib-force it is possible to compute the holding force of a magnet
attached magnetically to a soft-ferromagnetic plate. The "pull-force" is the
opposing force that is required to detach the magnet from the surface.

For this we make use of the "magnetic mirror" effect, which is quite similar to
the well-known electrostatic "mirror-charge" model. The magnetic field of a
magnetic dipole moment that lies in front of a highly permeable surface is
similar to the field of two dipole moments: the original one and one that is
mirrored across the surface such that each "magnetic charge" that makes up the
dipole moment is mirrored in both position and charge.

The following example computes the holding force of a Cuboid magnet using the
magnetic mirror effect.

```{code-block} python
import magpylib as magpy
from magpylib_force import getFT

# Target magnet
m1 = magpy.magnet.Cuboid(
    dimension=(5e-3, 2.5e-3, 1e-3),
    polarization=(0, 0, 1.33),
)
m1.meshing = 100

# Mirror magnet
m2 = m1.copy(position=(0,0,1e-3))

F,T = getFT(m2, m1)
print(f"Holding Force: {round(F[2]*100)} g")
# Holding Force: 349 g
```

Magnet dimensions and material from this example are taken from the
[web](https://www.supermagnete.at/quadermagnete-neodym/quadermagnet-5mm-2.5mm-1.5mm_Q-05-2.5-1.5-HN).
The remanence of N45 material lies within 1.32 and 1.36 T which corresponds to
the polarization, see also the
["Modeling a real magnet"](examples-tutorial-modeling-magnets) tutorial. The
computation confirms what is stated on the web-page, that the holding force of
this magnet is about 350 g.

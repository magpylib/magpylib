# Inhomogeneous Magnetization

The analytical expressions implemented in Magpylib treat only simple homogeneous polarizations. When dealing with high-grade materials that are magnetized in homogeneous fields this is a good approximation. However, there are many cases where such a homogeneous model is not justified. The tutorial {ref}`examples-tutorial-modeling-magnets` and the user-guide {ref}`guide-physics-demag` provide some insights on this topic.

Here we show how to deal with inhomogeneous polarization based on a commonly misunderstood example of a cylindrical quadrupol magnet. While graphical representations of such magnets usually depict only four poles, see {ref}`examples-vis-magnet-colors`, such magnets exhibit complex polarization given by the magnetization device that is used to magnetize them.

The following code shows how the field of such a magnetization device would look like and what magnetization field it produces. To relize a Cylindrical Quadrupole magnert there are four coils with ferromagnetic cores involved, arranged in circle around the magnet. In the example, coils and cores are modeled by Cuboid magnets.

```{note}
While Magpylib uses SI units by default, in this example we make use of [scaling invariance](guide-docs-io-scale-invariance) and consider arbitrary input length units. For this example millimeters are sensible.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import magpylib as magpy

# Create figure with 2D and 3D canvas
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(121, projection='3d')
ax2 = fig.add_subplot(122)

# Model of magnetization tool
tool1 = magpy.magnet.Cuboid(
    dimension=(5, 3, 3),
    polarization=(1, 0, 0),
    position=(9, 0, 0)
).rotate_from_angax(50, 'z', anchor=0)
tool2 = tool1.copy(polarization=(-1,0,0)).rotate_from_angax(-100, 'z', 0)
tool3 = tool1.copy().rotate_from_angax(180, 'z', 0)
tool4 = tool2.copy().rotate_from_angax(180, 'z', 0)
tool = magpy.Collection(tool1, tool2, tool3, tool4)

# Model of Quadrupole Cylinder

)

# Plot 3D model on ax1
magpy.show(cyl, tool, canvas=ax1, style_legend_show=False, style_magnetization_mode="color")
ax1.view_init(90, -90)

# Compute and plot tool-field on grid
grid = np.mgrid[-6:6:50j, -6:6:50j, 0:0:1j].T[0]
X, Y, _ = np.moveaxis(grid, 2, 0)

B = tool.getB(grid)
Bx, By, Bz = np.moveaxis(B, 2, 0)

ax2.streamplot(X, Y, Bx, By,
    color=np.linalg.norm(B, axis=2),
    cmap='autumn',
    density=1.5,
    linewidth=1,
)

# Outline magnet boundary
ts = np.linspace(0,2*np.pi,200)
ax2.plot(2*np.sin(ts), 2*np.cos(ts), color='k', lw=2)
ax2.plot(5*np.sin(ts), 5*np.cos(ts), color='k', lw=2)

# Plot styling

It can be assumed that the polarization that is written into the unmagnetized Cylinder will, in a lowest order approximation, follow the magnetic field generated by the magnetization tool. To create a Cylinder magnet with such a polarization pattern we apply the [superposition principle](examples-shapes-superpos) and approximate the inhomogneous polarization as the sum of multiple small homogeneous cells using the `CylinderSegment` class. Splitting up the Cylinder into many cells is easily done by hand, but for practicality we make use of the [magpylib-material-response](https://pypi.org/project/magpylib-material-response/) package which provides an excellent function for this purpose.

```{code-cell} ipython
# Continuation from above - ensure previous code is executed

from magpylib_material_response.meshing import mesh_Cylinder

# Create figure with 2D and 3D canvas
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(121, projection='3d')
ax2 = fig.add_subplot(122)

# Show Cylinder cells
mesh = mesh_Cylinder(cyl,30)
magpy.show(*mesh, canvas=ax1, style_magnetization_show=False)

# Apply polarization
for m in mesh:
    Btool = tool.getB(m.barycenter)
    m.polarization = Btool/np.linalg.norm(Btool)

# Compute and plot polarization
J = mesh.getJ(grid)
J[np.linalg.norm(J, axis=2) == 0] = np.nan # remove J=0 from plot
Jx, Jy, _ = np.moveaxis(J, 2, 0)

Jangle = np.arctan2(Jx, Jy)

ax2.contourf(X, Y, Jangle, cmap="rainbow", levels=30)
ax2.streamplot(X, Y, Jx, Jy, color='k')

# Outline magnet boundary
ts = np.linspace(0,2*np.pi,200)
ax2.plot(2*np.sin(ts), 2*np.cos(ts), color='k', lw=2)
ax2.plot(5*np.sin(ts), 5*np.cos(ts), color='k', lw=2)

# Plot styling
ax2.set(
    title="Polarization J in xy-plane",
    xlabel="x-position",
    ylabel="y-position",
    aspect=1,
)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

The color on the right-hand-side corresponds to the angle of orientation of the material polarization. Increasing the mesh finesse will improve the approximation but slow down any field computation at the same time.

**What is the purpose of this example ?** In addition to demonstrating how inhomogeneous polarizations can be modeled, this example should raise awareness that many magnets can look simple on a data sheet (color pattern) but may have an inhomogeneous, complex, unknown polarization distribution. It goes without saying that the magnetic field generated by such a magnet, for example in an angle sensing application, will depend strongly on the polarization.

# Position, Orientation, and Paths

The following secions are detiled technical documentations of the Magpylib position and orientation interface. Practical examples and good practice usage is demonstrated in the tutorial {ref}`examples-tutorial-paths`.

The analytical magnetic field expressions found in the literature, implemented in the [Magpylib core](docs-field-core), are given in native coordinates of the sources which is convenient for the mathematical formulation. It is a common problem to transform the field into an application relevant observer coordinate system. While not technically difficult, such transformations are prone to error.

Here Magpylib helps. All Magpylib sources and observers lie in a global Cartesian coordinate system. Object position and orientation are defined by the attributes `position` and `orientation`, üòè. Objects can easily be moved around using the `move()` and `rotate()` methods. Eventually, the field is computed in the reference frame of the observers (e.g. Sensor objects). Positions are given in units of meter, and the default unit for orientation is ¬∞.

## Position and orientation attributes

Position and orientation of all Magpylib objects are defined by the two attributes

::::{grid} 2
:gutter: 2

:::{grid-item-card}
:shadow: none
:columns: 12 5 5 5
<span style="color: orange">**position**</span> - a point $(x,y,z)$ in the global coordinates, or a set of such points $(\vec{P}_1, \vec{P}_2, ...)$. By default objects are created with `position=(0,0,0)`.
:::
:::{grid-item-card}
:shadow: none
:columns: 12 7 7 7
<span style="color: orange">**orientation**</span> - a [Scipy Rotation object](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation.html) which describes the object rotation relative to its default orientation (defined in {ref}`docs-classes`). By default, objects are created with unit rotation `orientation=None`.
:::
::::

The position and orientation attributes can be either **scalar**, i.e. a single position or a single rotation, or **vector**, when they are arrays of such scalars. The two attributes together define the **path** of an object - Magpylib makes sure that they are always of the same length. When the field is computed, it is automatically computed for the whole path.

```{tip}
To enable vectorized field computation, paths should always be used when modeling multiple object positions. Avoid using Python loops at all costs for that purpose! If your path is difficult to realize, consider using the [functional interface](docs-field-functional) instead.
```

## Move and Rotate

Magpylib offers two powerful methods for object manipulation:

::::{grid} 2
:gutter: 2

:::{grid-item-card}
:columns: 12 5 5 5
:shadow: none
<span style="color: orange">**move(**</span>`displacement`, `start="auto"`<span style="color: orange">**)**</span> -  move object by `displacement` input. `displacement` is a position vector (scalar input) or a set of position vectors (vector input).
:::
:::{grid-item-card}
:columns: 12 7 7 7
:shadow: none
<span style="color: orange">**rotate(**</span>`rotation`, `anchor=None`, `start="auto"`<span style="color: orange">**)**</span> - rotates the object by the `rotation` input about an anchor point defined by the `anchor` input. `rotation` is a [Scipy Rotation object](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation.html), and `anchor` is a position vector. Both can be scalar or vector inputs. With `anchor=None` the object is rotated about its `position`.
:::
::::

- **Scalar input** is applied to the whole object path, starting with path index `start`. With the default `start="auto"` the index is set to `start=0` and the functionality is **moving objects around** (incl. their whole paths).
- **Vector input** of length $n$ applies the $n$ individual operations to $n$ object path entries, starting with path index `start`. Padding applies when the input exceeds the existing path length. With the default `start="auto"` the index is set to `start=len(object path)` and the functionality is **appending the input**.

The practical application of this formalism is best demonstrated by the following program

```python
import magpylib as magpy
# Note that all units are in SI

sensor = magpy.Sensor()
print(sensor.position)                                    # Default value
#   --> [0. 0. 0.]

sensor.move((1,1,1))                                      # Scalar input is by default applied
print(sensor.position)                                    # to the whole path
#   --> [1. 1. 1.]

sensor.move([(1,1,1), (2,2,2)])                           # Vector input is by default appended
print(sensor.position)                                    # to the existing path
#   --> [[1. 1. 1.]  [2. 2. 2.]  [3. 3. 3.]]

sensor.move((1,1,1), start=1)                             # Scalar input and start=1 is applied
print(sensor.position)                                    # to whole path starting at index 1
#   --> [[1. 1. 1.]  [3. 3. 3.]  [4. 4. 4.]]

sensor.move([(0,0,10), (0,0,20)], start=1)                # Vector input and start=1 merges
print(sensor.position)                                    # the input with the existing path
#   --> [[ 1.  1.  1.]  [ 3.  3. 13.]  [ 4.  4. 24.]]     # starting at index 1.
```

Several extensions of the `rotate` method give a lot of flexibility with object rotation. They all feature the arguments `anchor` and `start` which work as described above.

When objects with different path lengths are combined, e.g. when computing the field, the shorter paths are treated as static beyond their end to make the computation sensible. Internally, Magpylib follows a philosophy of edge-padding and end-slicing when adjusting paths.

::::{grid} 2
:gutter: 2

:::{grid-item-card}
:columns: 12 7 7 7
:shadow: none
**Edge-padding:** whenever path entries beyond the existing path length are needed the edge-entries of the existing path are returned. This means that the object is ‚Äústatic‚Äù beyond its existing path.
:::
:::{grid-item-card}
:columns: 12 5 5 5
:shadow: none
**End-slicing:** whenever a path is automatically reduced in length, Magpylib will slice such that the ending of the path is kept.

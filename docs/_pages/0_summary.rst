MagPyLib Summary
----------------

The core module of magpylib is :mod:`~magpylib.source`, whose subpackages
offer the primitive building blocks for creating our simulation data.

The top level serves the :class:`magpylib.Collection`
class, which offers easy grouping of :mod:`~magpylib.source` objects,
allowing for the display and combination of fields.

The :mod:`~magpylib.math` module provides on-hand methods for handling axis
and angle information as well as rotation of position vectors.

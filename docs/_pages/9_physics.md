# Physics behind magpylib

Here we clarify some of the physics behind the analytical expressions that are provided by magpylib. Most also reflected in the paper **CITE PAPER HERE**

## The analytical solution

### Description of the anaytical solution
Formulas and expressions used in magpylib, references to literature

### Hard and soft magnetic materials
We cannot do soft, theres a lot of reasons we we dont need to

### Demagnetization
Solution accuracy


## Limits and Convergence

### Convergence of diametral Cylinder

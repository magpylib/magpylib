# About 
MagPyLib is an open-source Python library for calculating magnetic fields from permanent magnets and current distributions. It provides an intuitive class structure to **quickly generate, group, manipulate and visualize magnet assemblies and current distributions.**

The advantage of the **analytical approach** is the computation speed which can be in the sub millisecond range. This is easily **_five orders of magnitude faster_ when compared to FEM-based numerical calculations**. This makes MagPyLib highly efficient when dealing with multivariate global optimization problems that often appear in Magnetic System Design.

### Dependencies: 
_Python3.2+_, _Numpy_, _Matplotlib_

---
### Local Installation Instructions:
- Create virtual environment:
- 
```bash
$ conda create -n packCondaTest python=3.7.1 anaconda
```
- Activate:
- 
```bash
$ conda activate packCondaTest
```
- Generate distribution files (untracked by git):
- 
```bash
$ (packCondaTest) python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

- Install the generated library for the environment:
```bash
$ (packCondaTest) pip install .
```

The library is now in the packCondaTest environment.

### Examples:

The example program below shows how two permanent magnets are created and geometrically manipulated. They are grouped in a single collection and the system geometry is shown using a supplied method. The total magnetic field that is generated by the collection is calculated on a grid in the xz-plane and is displayed using matplotlib.

# collect magnets

# display system geometry

# display fields using matplotlib

U,V = Bs[:,:,0], Bs[:,:,2]
ax.streamplot(X, Y, U, V, color=np.log(U**2+V**2), density=1.5)
plt.show()
